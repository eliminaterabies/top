We are following this structure

TZ new_pipeline: https://github.com/eliminaterabies/rabiesTZ.git. Reads in files from the Glasgow database (currently WiseMonkey). Produces reports and files for the next step.

link: Takes a csv file produced by new_pipeline from a box and makes and links biter and bitten frames. The goal is to use products from link in both of our active projects (R0 and correlations)
