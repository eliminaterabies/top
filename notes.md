Trying to take centralized notes. Today we made a makefile in _this_ repo to keep track of our Dropboxes. 

We have a new-ish link repo and we are going to use that and the upstream pipeline repo (rabiesTZ) to do as much cleaning as we can, and pass cleaner things downstream.

We are currently rebuilding legacy code in egfR0 in R0paper, trying to drop as much as we can be shunting it upstream.
